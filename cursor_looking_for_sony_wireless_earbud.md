- All come with a standard 1-year warranty.

#### Recommendation:
If you are open to brands other than Sony, the **OnePlus Nord Buds3 Pro** is the best fit for your needs, offering excellent ANC, battery life, and audio quality within your budget.

If you specifically want Sony, you may need to increase your budget or compromise on ANC and battery life.
